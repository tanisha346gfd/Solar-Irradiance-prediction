# 🌞 Solar Irradiance Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses regression techniques to predict solar irradiance (sunlight intensity) based on weather and temporal features.

## 🧠 Objective

Help forecast solar energy availability by predicting sunlight levels using historical data.

## 📊 Key Steps

- Data Cleaning & Visualization
- Feature Engineering (Time, Temperature)
- Model Training (Linear Regression / Decision Tree)
- Evaluation with R² score and MAE

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Notebook

`Solar Irradiance Prediction.ipynb` – includes all code, visualizations, and results.
